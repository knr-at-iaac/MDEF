At first, I found this exercise very difficult. I loved all of the categories (after the nation state, design for the Anthropocene, killing hetero-patriarchy, life after AI, life in the times of Surveillance Capitalism). They seemed to capture a significant amount of the issues I believe are most important in our time (with, obviously a focus on technological aspects). Many of the possible technological developments and opportunities hinted at in the cards seemed to be promising. I  wanted to select way too many of the cards.  </p> <p>To get out of the paralysis of choice, I went back to the \u2018my fight\u2019 poster, which can be seen near the center of the board (in yellow, with text about being \u2018stuck*\u2019). Even though when I originally designed it, I had no intention or expectation of using it further, it proved to be valuable for this new task. The advantage it has is that I chose an issue which I feel affects me directly (despite living a comparitively privileged life). </p> <p>The central theme of the poster is the idea that work (as we know it) is an imposition that not only corrodes the joy of life by stealing the time we have but also tends to involve obligations to do things that are actively harmful for human and non-human life on earth. The proposed or imagined alternative is  \u2018playful production\u2019, where there are no hobbies and no jobs, and instead people collaborate to produce thing they truly want and need in a playful (and perhaps lazy) manner. It would also be interesting to explore the topics of AI replacing certain kinds of work, as well as the issue of care work in this context (which I am now realising more clearly). The two cards at the center of the design space represent the blurring of the lines between production (\u2018distributed factories on demand\u2019) and leisure (\u2018regenerative leisure\u2019) playful production would entail. This brings two further dimensions or clarifications into the picture: distributed design as a potential way of achieving a situation where more prodcution is done playfully, and regeneration, which can include a whole range of issues but puts some emphasis on responses to the climate crisis (which I believe to be perhaps the most pressing of the many intertwined crises we are facing in this century). </p> <p>Just above this pair of cards, I have placed Solarpunk and both Cities and Rural Futures as weak signals and/or opportunity spaces. The Solarpunk card (together with \u2018domestic productive spaces\u2019) were the random example cards Mariana showed us at the beginning of the AoWS card exercise. I was very enthusiastic when I saw those, because they fit so well with my vision of a better future. The internet aesthetic of Solarpunk has become a way to envision potential positive outcomes that involve the use of technology to satisfy human needs and authentic desires in a way which limits - or perhaps even reverses - the destruction of ecosystems and terrain. It also carries a strong heritage of DIY ethics and anti-authoritarian politics (as the \u2018punk\u2019 suffix should make obvious), as well as anti-capitalist, anti-racist, anti-colonial, feminist, etc struggles. I find it interesting as a way to point to the importance of culture in shaping futures as well. For me, the blurring of lines between rural areas, so-called wilderness and cities chimes with solarpunk because the ways of living together that such a future would involve likely would \u2018rewild\u2019 large areas, as well as making rural areas more city-like in some regards and cities more involved in food production (so perhaps more rural). </p> <p>Lunarpunk -to me- is solarpunk\u2019s more cynical, individualist and \u2018realist\u2019 cousin. I have since learned that it is also a kind of more \u2018gothy\u2019 aesthetic (which is not that related to what I have in mind, though perhaps a bit). It involves taking a hard look at the dangers projects that try to build Commons in a solarpunk fashion might face from economically interested actors, nation-states, reactionary non-state actors, etc. It might also involve a more \u2018mutualist\u2019 as compared to solarpunk\u2019s \u2018commons\u2019-oriented view, where enlightened self-interest could play a more important role. I would find it interesting to explore those strands of thought as perhaps being two sides of the same coin. Some of the theoretical influences on these ideas are represented on the bottom right of the board.</p> <p>Moving on to the more concrete area (towards the left of the board) - where I collected cards that seemed to point to more concrete starting points for exploring distributed design for playful production and sketched ideas for it - thinking about lunarpunk and the importance of education in distributed design made me think about the model of the night school, and how many people who might benefit from playful production may have time then. It also seems strange to me (and this is perhaps a more personal approach, as a night person) that there are so few workshops and other events of that nature at night. Perhaps some bars could become distributed places of playful production for regenerative leisure on weekdays, where they often remain relatively empty?</p> <p>The connection between \u2018lazy agriculture\u2019 (also towards the left side of the board) for which The Dawn of Everything was my inspiration, and distributed manufacturing was somehow present in my mind but pointed out to me in my first design review session (with Jonathan).

On a dark autumn night, I read this one.</p> <p>Is a university blog post a news article? In our world of democratised access to the means of publishing, I\u2019d argue that it counts. But that\u2019s a matter to be discussed somewhere else. Mostly, it served as an excuse for me to explore the issue of small-scale farming, which I was already interested in but which the Bio/Agro Zero course also made more salient. I\u2019m especially interested in sustainability and the question of which kind of agriculture maximises calories/nutriment per hectare.</p> <p>The article summarizes claims made by a scientist who took part in the IPCC, Jack Heinemann. The core claims are that small-scale farmers (who are mostly women) feed 80% of the world\u2019s population, that they do so by growing different crops together and that they thereby avoid many of the carbon-intensive inputs required for industrial monocultures while maintaining a level of (social/economic) autonomy.</p> <p>I am enclined to believe all of these claims, because they suit my intuitive and ideological impulses. All the more reason to assess them critically (besides it being the assigned task). </p> <p>To start out, let us take a look at an  article co-written by the subject of the news article himself. It makes an interesting distinction between different approaches to building food security and fighting hunger. The authors consider herbicide resistant GM crops to be an example of a top-down approach, which ultimately centralises power and stunts technological development (because of its \u2018black box\u2019 nature) and contras this with agro-ecology, which they take to be a \u2018bottom-up\u2019 approach which favours technological development that serves people who need it the most. While it seems clear that some GM crops could be designed in a way which is adapted to such needs as well, the example serves to highlight questions that should always be asked when we assessthe use of a technology: for what purpose is it deployed, and what is its impact on power dynamics.</p> <p>The latter is not just important as a political question, it can also serve as a kind of error theory, explaining why maladaptation and suboptimal distributions of resources occur despite seemingly obvious drawbacks and the urgency of global warming. Many people may assume that industrial agriculture is the most efficient way to feed the world. But if we take into account its \u2018externalities\u2019 and the growing need of maximising calories/nutrition per unit of land (due to population growth, the need to producein close proximity  or inside of cities, and the need to make space for carbon-capturing ecosystems), the picture may look very different. </p> <p>\u2026Much remains to be assessed, starting with the core claims mentioned at the beginning, and perhaps continuing with an exploration of the advantages and drawbacks of methods such as permaculture, agroecology, and other techniques suited to and used by small scale agriculturalists. Perhaps this article could be a starting point. Following that, it would be interesting to explore what makes small-scale small scale. A collection of small scale production sites (even geographically adjacent) is large scale in a certain sense, but may not necessarily have the same drawbacks as current industrial farming techniques. This relates to social modes of organisation involving \u2018fractal\u2019 or federated scaling in ways that may be interesting.</p> <p>However, it is Sunday at 23:45 and I will have to continue these musings some other time. </p>"},{"location":"term1/04-DesignStudio/","title":"Design Studio","text":""},{"location":"term1/04-DesignStudio/#fragments-of-a-communication-strategy-13-nov-22","title":"Fragments of a communication strategy [13 nov 22]","text":"<p>\u201cIn love as in war, all is fair, and communication is key\u201d      - some dead posh white guy who shouldn\u2019t have squares named after him, probably</p> <p>Unfortunately, I missed the class on communication (for which this is the deliverable), but I took a look at the shared documents.

Due to captured forms of interdependence, we are unable to escape work. At work, we do a lot of things we don\u2019t want to do, many which are actively harmful. Even the most subversive practices tend to require the use of products which come from extractive and exploitative supply chains. Our most intimate spaces are filled with such artefacts.

Under the resulting emerging paradigm(s) of design, many practices engaged in by people who would not call themselves designers could also be conceived as such. This raises two somewhat orthogonal but related questions. 1) Does it make sense to redefine design in this way? And 2) What role - if any - can design play in moving towards less actively harmful forms of human life? I will attempt to answer them in order.</p> <p>There is a difficulty in answering the first question. Usually, we might first give a working definition of the central terms involved in a question and base our arguments on it. This angle of attack is unavailable here, since the question is about the process of defining itself. How can we evaluate whether it makes sense to redefine design if we haven\u2019t agreed on what design is? To escape this situation, let\u2019s zoom out a bit.</p> <p>How we think and talk about social phenomena not only reflects patterns of human behaviour, it can also itself contribute to their normalisation and continued ubiquity. Deconstructing and redefining a field of human  activity can help change the activity itself by changing the self-conception of practitioners, the external view on it, activities that are considered part of it, etc. </p> <p>Consider the case of accounting. There are efforts to transform the practice of accounting from one that serves extraction to one that may help us transform society, build resilience, and perhaps contribute to a liberated society. Examples of this include the creative use of Resources, Events, Agents (see McCarthy, 1982) accounting in Web3 communities and alternative currencies. An example out of prefigurative politics is the concept of \u2018anarchist accounting\u2019, an exploration of what accounting would look like in a radically different and egalitarian world (see Sandstroem 2021).</p> <p>The reason it \u2018makes sense\u2019 to redefine accounting in this manner is that there are recognisable similarities between the historical (and contemporary) practice and the proposed alternative way of engaging in it. Both involve counting, carefully writing down numbers intended to reflect the world in an effort to act upon it in some way. While the goal of the practice, and some of the activities proposed are different from the \u2018original\u2019, arguably some core part of accounting (as it exists) is captured and remains part of the proposed, redefined sense of accounting. </p> <p>The effect such a redefinition can have on social reality is one of the reasons why one may think it worthwhile to redefine \u2018design\u2019. However, while it may make sense to redefine accounting as a practice that accounts for environmental impact, it does not make sense to redefine the banana as a bathtub (or banana-eating as bathtub-making). There must be some connection between the new meaning and core features of the previous one (in the context at issue). Failing to do so leads to confusion and is unlikely to convince a significant amount of people.</p> <p>If there is a fruitful way to redefine design as an activity that contributes to (desired) transitions, the activities that newly fall under the label must be in some way \u2018designy\u2019. They must have some understandable connection to practices that already fell under the label in its historical or contemporary sense, and core practices within it should somehow be adapted or transformed in a way that serves a new purpose (as in the example of accounting). </p> <p>This leaves us with the task of defining design in its \u2018original\u2019 sense (the one we might wish to define away from). Design, in this sense, arguably includes at least three definitions: 1) an academic discipline 2) a set of roles one can play (e.g. work as) as part of companies, corporations, and other organisations that make up our current political economy, and 3) an evolving set of practices already understood as being \u2018design\u2019, such as product design, UX design, service design, architecture, system design, graphic design, speculative design, etc, etc. </p> <p>Definitions 1) and 2) partly motivate the project of redefining design. The resources available to design as an academic discipline and as part of business and other activities could be diverted towards liberatory and transformative practices. They are less relevant, however, if we\u2019re searching for a definitional core to be preserved as part of a project of redefinition towards a more liberatory and less extractive understanding of design, at least if we agree that a transition towards significantly less extractive ways of living requires a radical transformation of social reality. </p> <p>Here is why: it is unlikely that such a transition can be solely - or even primarily - driven by academic and professional practices that are dominant today. If global social systems are transformed so significantly, then design may not consist in academic or professional practices of the kind that we know today. Academic, and especially professional organisations (such as companies) form part of the very structures of power and domination existing today that enable the extractive practices which we are attempting to transcend (for information on the complex interplay between extractive practices and status quo social organisation, see e.g. Moore 2017)</p> <p>While it is possible that legacy organisations are radically transformed while maintaining their names (e.g. university, \u2018corporation\u2019,\u2026), leaving aside the definitions of design which conceptualise it as an academic and professional discipline will allow for a more realistic and open-ended understanding of how design could transform the world by and while transforming itself. So let us use the third definition, which concieves of design an evolving set of \u2018designy\u2019 practices and approaches. These could potentially be repurposed and mobilised for a transition towards a less extractive and hierarchical world.</p> <p>Given this definition, what role can design play in moving towards less harmful ways of living? Two distinctions can help us answer this question. </p> <p>First, we should differentiate between design practices that are practiced within legacy organisations (e.g. corporations, governmental bodies, traditional NGOs, etc), and those that form part of a collective effort to build alternatives to such ways of organising (e.g. grassroots NGOs, mutual aid networks, some DAOs, alternative currency initiatives, community land trusts, some cooperatives, squats, self organised cultural centers, community gardens, etc). </p> <p>We can also make a distinction between two poles of design. One is closer to engineering and for example includes the more technical aspects of architecture, systems design, and product design. The other is more about aesthetics, desire, and shaping experience. This includes for example most practices that fall under graphic design, UX design, the design aspects of marketing, and the more aesthetic and sensory aspects of product design.</p> <p>This rough typology leaves us with two times two, so four ways design could (and to some extent arguably does) contribute towards a social and ecological transition.</p> <p>The first set concerns designing within legacy organisations. </p> <p>On the more technical side of things, concerning how various elements are put together to form an artefact or system, there arguably isn\u2019t that much to be gained. The goals for which designers are optimising for here are usually pretty clear (for example, given a certain product, make it cheaper and sturdier, but also modular). Design is to a large extent about making decisions, so within the relatively narrow space left, designers may have some agency. For instance, a more sustainable material may be chosen, or a system made more accessible to people that diverge from some norm. But overall, this does not seem like the place where radical change can be implemented consciously.</p> <p>On the more aesthetic side of things, which includes shaping and working with desires of potential users, we are in a similar situation. Again, designers have some agency here. For instance, they may choose not to use an enticing aesthetic that reproduces harmful patterns (like sexism)\u00b8or avoid contributing to an overly homogenising cultural patterns by working in a way which is sensitive and interested in local idiosyncracies and sensibiliities. But, again, the potential here seems relatively limited.</p> <p>This leaves us within a second - perhaps more promising - set of ways design could contribute towards less harmful and more regenerative ways of living. Outside of legacy organisations, design certainly has a role to play in building alternatives. </p> <p>On the more technical side, it can help redesign patterns of human life, either by bringing together existing technologies in new ways or by innovating on and remixing older techniques, thereby building alternative systems that serve regenerative purposes. Think, for example, of designers making an open source system for water purification, small-scale farming, or energy production using off the shelf parts combined with parts that can be manufactured in a distributed manner (e.g. with 3D printers, CNC mills or laser cutters). Given how central (for example) energy production, food systems, and water scarcity are in global political and economic dynamics, redesigning them - e.g. making appropriate and decentralised deployments of technology easier by designing and open sourcing alternative patterns - could end up having profound emergent effects on social and ecological reality. </p> <p>The more aesthetic side of design (which some may consider design proper) can be mobilised to support the aforementioned more technical redesigning efforts, for example by making artefacts aesthetically appealling, alternative systems desirable, and decentralising efforts beautiful. It may also play a broader social role in redesigning cultural patterns This side of design also bears significant potential worth exploring by those who seek regenerative change.</p> <p>In addition to the practices of redesigning just mentioned, design practiced outside of legacy organisations can also contribute in significant ways to practices of contestation that we may collect under the umbrella term \u2018dedesigning\u2019. This includes speculative and critical design, using graphic design in political projects that pursue liberatory purposes, as well as reverse engineering, remixing, deconstructing, subverting, and undermining existing systems and artefacts that stand in the way of regenerative change. </p> <p>Overall, it makes sense to carefully redefine design more broadly in an effort to leverage the liberatory potential of design practices, especially when mobilised as part of collective efforts to build alternative systems to legacy organisations. Fleshing out the details of such a liberatory design practice could be an interesting continuation of the approach sketched in this text. Design thinking, the cognitive patterns associated with certain design practices - which we left aside in this essay - could be examined as part of such continued research. That would make sense, I think.</p>"},{"location":"term2/05-Communication/","title":"Communicating ideas","text":"<p>\u201cTell me what you want, what you really really really want\u201d - the Spice Girls</p> <p>A recurring issue I ran into as a child was that people would be less likely to believe me when I was telling the truth.

This has a recursive character, because the melody modified and chosen from is - at each run of the main loop - the one that came out of the previous run (if there is one). </p> <p>One small detail that I found interesting is that someone on the internet recommended to use the input of a pin that is not connected to anything to generate \u2018random\u2019 noise. (and that\u2019s what we did). </p> <p>This activity reminded me how fun it can be to write code, especially when the quality is not that important. The code is not very well written or documented, and it would have been more elegant to write it in a way which is more adaptable for different purposes. In the coming weeks I hope to experience the joy of writing slightly more thought through code as well.</p>"},{"location":"term2/07-prototypingDesign/#criss-crossing-croissant-curves-day-2","title":"criss-crossing croissant curves - day 2","text":"<p>This session gave me a better understanding of computer assisted design and manufacturing.

It\u2019s exciting to think about the potential (and current apploications) of these techniques for distributed design and local mass customisation. On a more personal note, the prospect of \u2018outsourcing\u2019 some of the engineering grunt work to a machine is very appealing. It makes designing something truly adapted to its environment seem much more feasible and less tedious than what I would have imagined. The complex and \u2018organic-ish\u2019 aesthetics of many (semi-autoomatically) topologically optimised and partly AI-generated design is also interesting.

Perhaps there is an option to force them to connect. Perhaps them not being connnected is not an issue.

But here are some of my more personal thoughts.</p> <p>Personally, I really appreciated using some of the Fab Lab machines for the first time. I had used a laser cutter before, but not one of this size. It turned out to be quite intuitive, once I got used to it. I found myself wishing I could continue cutting out things all day/night, and try them out. It was like debugging for physical things - better suited to my sensibilities than the discipline necessary for manual work of a similar precision.</p> <p>The group I was a part of for this challenge was comparatively large  (four people). After deciding the general design together, we split up in two groups of two, Cagsun and Ramiro focusing on the electronics, Josephine and me focusing on the enclosure / non-electronic physical design parts. Having some experience with writing code (though not so much in writing it for Arduino), and almost none in product design / laser cutter based making, I decided to be part of the latter effort so as to explore what I know least.</p> <p>The sandwich approach we used to design a tap for a water-tight tube (layering three acrylic cutouts and adding a rubber ring to make a tap) was interesting to me. Using a laser cutter and designing in 2D seemed rather intuitive to me, so I was happy to discover some of the 3D applications of that. </p> <p>I also gained a renewed appreciation for how involved it is to design any kind of object from scratch. Making the water sensing tube seemed like it would take less time than it did. As we went through the process of designing and making it, I felt some things accelerate. Personally, I get the feeling that it will be faster next time. Even though - at times - it was a bit discouraging to be reminded of how complicated manufacturing can be (as someone who would like to eventually transcend at least a significant amount of dependence on mass industrial production), I appreciated gaining more of a grasp on these topics. I also believe that we are beginning to see alternatives to centrally controlled extractive industry emerge, and I am hopeful that more mass customisation, decentralisation of control, distribution of production, etc is yet to come.

Instead, like everyone, we ended up copy-pasting the recommended code (found on the course docs) and modifying it slightly.</p> <p>The final stage was about using the MQTT protocol (like we did in an earlier session) to have synchronous LED animations based on choices in a dashboard all could access. This worked, and was fun. To see what it looks like, refer to other student\u2019s websites (what I filmed ended up a bit blurry). </p> <p>It was fun to take part in this session, and all the steps we went through together ended up working at our table. It strengthened my desire to get back into writing code, and to explore Arduino-based projects specifically. However, I do not have much to say about the details of the process itself. We successfully followed the steps described in the documentation of the course. Please refer to that documentation (linked above) if you wish to reproduce such an exploration. </p>"},{"location":"term2/07-prototypingDesign/#collets-not-bullets-day-8","title":"collets not bullets - day 8","text":"<p>This session was especially interesting to me because I had previously had no intimate contact with the topic of CNC mills. So the technical overview was both inspiring and slightly intimidating. Seeing the machine in action, however, made me really want to design for it, and make something with it\u2019s help. </p> <p>Bits of information in this session that stood out to me:</p> <ul> <li> <p>robot arms in industrial manufacturing tend to work like workers in the early stages of industrialsation - repeating the same task over and over again. The story about the robot arm in the FabLab, which works well until it gets into the particular motion it used to perform in it\u2019s previous life in an industrial setting left me wondering (somehwat naively, perhaps) if a rotation of tasks among robots could extend their (industrial?) lifespans, or if there could not be a more simple way of performing the exact same task over and over again (designing a cheaper system that is only able to perform that task, or sets of tasks, but is easy to modify physically). Why use the equivalent of making a 3D printer print the same thing over and over again, instead of making a (metaphorical) adjustable mold? These thoughts may only reflect my lack of domain expertise, however.</p> </li> <li> <p>another thing I wondered about, and did not get a complete answer to in the course was the question of compounding errors. Is there a kind of production which has some space for error tolerance, but which would benefit from the machines making errors not making the same error, which compounds over time, but rather making randomised (and distinct) errors? If the machines were rotated through tasks (like imagined in the previous point), could this have an advantage in terms of absolute deviation from the intended design (because the errors can go in all directions, they nd up closer to the intended shape than if they continued along one particular direction)? Again, the question likely reflects a lack of understanding on my part. </p> </li> <li> <p>It was amusing to hear about all the jargon present in the field of CNCing (like in most others). Being part of a Master\u2019s that absolutely loves jargon, I am not in a position to judge. A lens akin to the sociology of academic disciplines could, however, potentially be fruitfully applied to this.</p> </li> <li> <p>there were a lot of very specific technical details, that I will only really remember  once I tried CNC milling out myself. For example, the fact that corners may be round due to the shape of the thing that is not called a bit because it\u2019s not in a manual drill (something which is relevant for press fit designs especially). The same goes for the details of how to give instructions to the machine given a particular curve delineating the design (cutting inside of it, outside of it, centered, \u2026).</p> </li> <li> <p>I was glad to hear about open source tools that are available for designs that are CNC millable. Open Source feels like a testament to human potential like few other things that are distinctly contemporary. For example, Deepnest allows you to nest the things to be cut in a way which minimises material waste (one of the disadvantages of substractive manufacturing like CNC milling). The 50 digital joint collection also looked exciting. I will try some of those out for sure.</p> </li> </ul> <p>I will leave other technical details (which I learned and put in my personal notes) out of this reflection. They can be found in the course presentation itself. </p> <p>Originally, I planned to do the CNC assignment (doing something with the CNC) as part of the second challenge. The reason is that we were planning on pooling our assigned wood plank resources to make something together with the group.</p> <p>In the end, however, it turns out that some wood was left, and I wanted to hone my (previously non-existent) CNC skills.</p> <p>I tried making a flywheel. The idea is to use cans filled with something heavy as weights. The many options, tolerances, etc struck me as more difficult than using a laser cutter or a 3D printer. I\u2019m planning on using the CNC as much as possible in the last trimester to gain the necessary experience to use the machine without feeling lost.</p> <p>Here are my results (not post-processed yet because I cut it just before leaving for the research trip\u2026).</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"term2/07-prototypingDesign/#the-second-challenge-grey-is-the-new-green","title":"The second challenge - Grey is the new green","text":"<p>I wrote most of my thoughts on the second challenge in the collective document</p> <p>Much like the second trimester in general, a lot of this challenge for me was discovering how involved seemingly simple processes are when it comes to manufacturing.

It was also exciting to see how many different tools one could use with such an arm, and all the possibilities that entails. On the other hand the wide range of possibilities also makes it seem like a tool that should be used in a way that reflects its adaptability, rotating tasks instead of making it do the same thing over and over (or things that other machines can do as well). Anything else seems overkill or underwhelming.
